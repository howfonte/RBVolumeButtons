SpringBoard




This tweak/app actually let's you outright get SpringBoard from iOS 7 betas/GM/public builds from Hamza Sood (@hamzasood on Twitter). 

This tweak/app needs updating constantly due to the "complete lack of skills for developing a simple iOS app" from the developer.

Please do not hesitate to contact me at the following email address: chasefromm@mail.com.

There will be an "INSTALL" button (without quotes) provided on thus README.md file soon.
